  <h1>Introducing Kaylee</h1>
  I am Kaylee and I am eighteen years old. I completed my high school education with Academic Honors, graduating a year ahead of schedule. Currently, I am pursuing my higher education at a University in Indiana. My major is Art Education, complemented by a minor in graphic design and fine arts.</p>

  Additionally, I hold the position of Representative at Large and Graphic Designer for the Student Government Association of the University and actively participate in various committees. Alongside these commitments, I also dedicate my time as a Sunday School teacher, photographer and actively engage and volunteer in my church and community.
